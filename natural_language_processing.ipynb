    "Let's pretend we have an email with three words: \"Send money now.\" We'll use Naive Bayes to classify it as **ham or spam.** (\"Ham\" just means not spam. It can include emails that look like spam but that you opt into!)\n",

    "\n",
    "- The \"naive\" assumption of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.\n",
    "- The normalization constant (the denominator) can be ignored since it's the same for all classes.\n",
    "- The prior probability is much less relevant once you have a lot of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Naive Bayes With Other Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training and prediction are very fast.\n",
    "- It's somewhat interpretable.\n",
    "- No tuning is required.\n",
    "- Features don't need scaling.\n",
    "- It's insensitive to irrelevant features (with enough observations).\n",
    "- It performs better than logistic regression when the training set is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If \"spam\" is dependent on non-independent combinations of individual words, it may not work well.\n",
    "- Predicted probabilities are not well calibrated.\n",
    "- Correlated features can be problematic (due to the independence assumption).\n",
    "- It can't handle negative features (with Multinomial Naive Bayes).\n",
    "- It has a higher \"asymptotic error\" than logistic regression.\n",
