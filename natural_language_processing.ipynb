    "Understanding how positive or negative a review is. There are many ways in practice to compute a sentiment value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have a list of \"positive\" words and a list of \"negative\" words and count how many occur in a document. \n",
    "- Train a classifier given many examples of \"positive\" documents and \"negative\" documents. \n",

    "For the most accurate sentiment analysis, you will want to train a custom sentiment model based on documents that are particular to your application. Generic models (such as the one we are about to use!) often do not work as well as hoped."

    "\n",
    "Let's pretend we have an email with three words: \"Send money now.\" We'll use Naive Bayes to classify it as **ham or spam.** (\"Ham\" just means not spam. It can include emails that look like spam but that you opt into!)\n",

    "\n",
    "- The \"naive\" assumption of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.\n",
    "- The normalization constant (the denominator) can be ignored since it's the same for all classes.\n",
    "- The prior probability is much less relevant once you have a lot of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Naive Bayes With Other Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training and prediction are very fast.\n",
    "- It's somewhat interpretable.\n",
    "- No tuning is required.\n",
    "- Features don't need scaling.\n",
    "- It's insensitive to irrelevant features (with enough observations).\n",
    "- It performs better than logistic regression when the training set is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If \"spam\" is dependent on non-independent combinations of individual words, it may not work well.\n",
    "- Predicted probabilities are not well calibrated.\n",
    "- Correlated features can be problematic (due to the independence assumption).\n",
    "- It can't handle negative features (with Multinomial Naive Bayes).\n",
    "- It has a higher \"asymptotic error\" than logistic regression.\n",
